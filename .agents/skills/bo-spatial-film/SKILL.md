description: BO Spatial Film - make a 45-90 s unnarrated spatial 3D motion graphic (one CSS-3D camera, push-throughs, no hard cuts, last frame loops into the first) with real product UI, platform-faithful cloud and data canvases (Microsoft Fabric Eventstream, KQL Eventhouse, OneLake Lakehouse, Direct Lake Power BI, GHL, n8n), a native-tempo music bed and SFX, rendered at 1080p60 via HyperFrames. Tailored for enterprise data engineering and spatial product portfolios.

# BO Spatial Film

Created by Kenneth Villar ([BrewedOps](https://brewedops.com)). Proven end to end on the BrewedShot Pro 60s film
(2026-10-04: 7 scenes, 5 workers in one wave, every seam frame-exact, check clean, 1080p60 in 4m19s). The
template's `film.json` holds that film's real scene bars and cue sheet as the worked example.

`<skill>` = this skill's folder (Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/bo-spatial-film`). Run every script from the film
project root. On macOS/Linux use `python3` where this skill says `python`.

## What you need

- Node 22+, `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH, Python 3 with `numpy` and `Pillow`, and bash (Git Bash on Windows).
- The HyperFrames skills: `npx hyperframes skills update general-video hyperframes-animation media-use` (packet
  builder, blueprints + animation map, music helper). The CLI itself is pinned per project and runs through `npx`.
- Playwright for pre-rendering surfaces: `npm i -D playwright` in the film folder (or set `PLAYWRIGHT_PATH`).
- Optional, for sourced music: a HeyGen account - run `npx hyperframes auth login` once in your own terminal.
  Without it, bring your own track and start phase 4 at `music-analyze.py`.
- A GPU-capable machine for the final render (it still renders on the software path, about 15x slower).

## How to use this skill without wasting context

- Load ONE phase reference at a time, when its phase starts. Never preload them all.
- Scripts are the proven code. Run them; never regenerate their logic inline.
- The main session never reads a whole scene file (20-60KB). Judge scenes by contact sheets; fix with `grep -n`
  plus an exact patch.
- Workers get file PATHS, not pasted content. `storyboard.html` (60KB+) is grepped by cell id, never read whole.
- Read a contact sheet first; open single snapshot PNGs only to check a detail.

## Phases (each ends on a gate - do not move on until it passes)

| # | Phase | Load | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffold: `node <skill>/scripts/new-film.mjs <dir> --name <slug>` | - | folder has film.json, frame.md, kit, template docs |
| 1 | Intake, BRIEF, STORYBOARD, sketch sheet | `references/storyboard.md` | user's explicit "go" recorded under `## Locked` |
| 2 | frame.md, kit, pre-rendered surfaces | `references/surfaces.md` (+ `platform-canvases.md` only if GHL/n8n/Zapier appear) | no `{{` in frame.md; every capture PNG looked at |
| 3 | Harness smoke test, packets, parallel workers | `references/workers.md` | every scene: lint 0 errors, contact sheet matches its block |
| 4 | Music + SFX (run while workers build) | `references/audio.md` | bed at native BPM, bar 0 on a downbeat; cues in film.json |
| 5 | Assemble, check, seams, render, ship | `references/verify-ship.md` | check passes, seam-check all PASS, hardware-gpu render verified |

Route through `/hyperframes` -> `/general-video` for the intent and sketch-review steps (this skill supplies
the project shape, contract, scripts and gates; general-video supplies the packet builder and worker role).

## Narrated films (a voiceover + an on-screen presenter)

Proven on KAPE AI "API vs Webhook" (2026-10-05: 83s, 1080x1920 vertical, Taglish PVC voice, mascot presenter,
10 scenes by 5 workers). The music-film rules above still hold except where these replace them:

- **Voice candidates first.** `EL=<key> python <skill>/scripts/el-tts.py . eric=<voice_id> michelle=<voice_id>`
  reads the indented lines of `SCRIPT.md` and writes one MP3 per voice to `src/audio/voice-candidates/` (key from
  env only, never on disk). Let the user pick by ear, then transcribe only the pick.
- **Narration is the clock.** Word times: `EL=<key> python <skill>/scripts/el-words.py <voice.mp3>
  src/timing/voice-words.json` (ElevenLabs Scribe - no local model, seconds; a client film, 2026-10-07: the user
  rejected a local faster-whisper run twice, Scribe was the accepted path), or faster-whisper with
  `word_timestamps` (language set, VAD on). Keep the word JSON in `src/timing/`. In `film.json` set `"bpm": 60, "beats_per_bar": 1` so a "bar" is 1s and scene
  lengths are plain seconds cut in the sentence pauses. Storyboard blocks give scene-local word times; arrivals
  start ~0.1s early and land on the word. Give a title at least ~1s on screen before the next cut (check the cut
  against the LAST word of the line it shows).
- **`film.json` extras** (assemble.py + make-harness.py read them): `"audio": [{id, src, dur, volume}]` for the
  voice, `"overlays": [{id, track, z}]` for a full-film layer (the presenter) that sits above every scene, so it
  never pops at a seam and the scenes stay presenter-free.
- **Presenter from a sprite sheet:** cut + upscale the poses (KapeAI `films/_tools/cut-mascot.py` is the worked
  example: painted-checkerboard removal, lenses kept, 4x Real-ESRGAN anime via spandrel), then
  `scripts/blink-fit.py <mascot_dir>` (fits the sheet's BLINK eye band onto each pose by NCC; poses under 0.70 get
  no blink) and `scripts/build-presenter.py` (writes the overlay from `src/presenter-track.json`: poses on cue
  words, head-anchored so swaps never jump, voice-envelope bob, breath, blinks, fx). Never hand-edit its output.
- **Audio:** loudnorm the voice to -16 LUFS / -1.5 dBTP (a plain gain clipped at +4.6 dBTP), sidechain-duck the
  bed under it offline (~17 dB below the voice), SFX quiet (0.1-0.45). Pad the voice key or the duck truncates
  the bed to the voice length (check warned "bgm 110.25s vs slot 113s"):
  `[1:a]apad=whole_dur=<TOTAL>[k];[0:a][k]sidechaincompress=threshold=0.03:ratio=6:attack=25:release=450,atrim=end=<TOTAL>`.
  No catalog bed (HeyGen search 500s or no login): `EL=<key> python <skill>/scripts/el-music.py .media/candidates/bed.mp3
  <ms> "<prompt: instrumental, BPM, sits under a narrator, no drops, ends on a resolved chord>"` - a track that
  winds down on its own at the film's length needs no splice.
- **Seam check noise:** the presenter moves across every seam, so `seam-check.py` FAILs on him alone. Judge each
  flagged pair with `scripts/seam-diff.py a.png b.png out.png x0,y0,x1,y1` (masks the presenter box) - 0.00%
  outside it is a pass.
- **Vertical (1080x1920) size law:** every scene's top band carries a real headline (60-84px), body text >= 40px,
  objects use the full width and the height above the presenter. The first wave shipped ~33px text in the top
  45% of the frame - put these numbers in frame.md before dispatch, not after.
- **Not a loop:** a narrated film ends on a held lockup; ignore the loop line of seam-check.

## Hard rules (the ones that make it premium and smooth)

1. **Truth from source.** Product UI is ported from the product's own HTML/CSS; third-party canvases are rebuilt
   from the user's real captures, never memory. Fictional data only. Only features the product really has.
2. **One camera.** Perspective 1866px (35mm) in every scene; a drift layer under the cam layer so nothing is ever
   still; parallax + DOF blur on far leaves. No opacity/filter/overflow/clip-path on a 3D parent (it flattens).
3. **Crisp at 1080p+.** Scale UI with CSS `zoom` (`.kit-zoom`), never `transform: scale(>1)`; author each piece at
   its closest on-screen size; captures are 2x PNGs shown at or below native.
4. **60fps smoothness law.** Transform/opacity only; springs for landings, expo/power3 for arrivals, inOut for
   camera legs; no linear, steps, snap or rounding; camera legs overlap 0.15-0.3s and last 0.6s+.
5. **Deterministic.** One paused timeline per scene registered last on `window.__timelines[id]`, `fromTo` with
   explicit starts, no random/clock/CSS transitions.
6. **Seams are shared frames.** Each seam is one exact picture both neighbours hold ~0.1s, locked by a 2D plate
   outside the rig. No hard cut, no empty frame, no fade-to-nothing. Last frame = first frame.
7. **On the grid.** Scenes are whole/half bars; clicks, ticks, stamps and swaps land on beats; music at its native
   tempo cut on bar lines.
8. **Contract fixes, not scene fixes.** Root-relative `assets/...` paths, ids never starting with a digit, ids and
   classes prefixed with the scene id. A rule every scene would break is fixed once in frame.md / worker-brief.
9. **Bans.** No emoji, neon glow, purple-to-blue gradient, colored left-border cards, circular spinners (shimmer),
   stock people, "John Doe", slideshow pacing or motion that says nothing.
10. **Finals from the CLI with the hardware GPU.** Never Studio's Export (software path, ~15x slower).
11. **3D Local-Space Alignment Law (Zero Parallax Drift).** Never place an interactive cursor or touch pointer on the global 2D stage when targeting a 3D-transformed surface (`rotateY`, `rotateX`, `translateZ`). Always mount the cursor directly inside the transformed 3D slab container (`#slab-container`), and compute coordinates via intrinsic local scaling:
    $$X_{\text{local}} = X_{\text{native}} \times \left(\frac{W_{\text{slab}}}{W_{\text{native}}}\right), \quad Y_{\text{local}} = Y_{\text{native}} \times \left(\frac{H_{\text{slab}}}{H_{\text{native}}}\right)$$
    Let the parent container's CSS 3D matrix (`transform-style: preserve-3d`) resolve camera angle, perspective, and depth skew automatically.

## When things go wrong

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Lint: asset path error | `../assets/` in a sub-composition | root-relative `assets/...` (fix in the contract) |
| Lint: invalid composition id | id starts with a digit | `s01-click`, never `01-click` (film.py refuses it) |
| Packet builder throws / packet > 48KB | two blueprint ids, or too many `rules:` | one `id (Adapt)`; 2-3 rules per block |
| UI looks soft | transform-scaled or pushed toward camera past authored size | `.kit-zoom`, author at closest size |
| 3D suddenly flat | opacity/filter/overflow on a 3D ancestor | move it to the leaf |
| Seam pops | one side not holding the shared frame | `seam-check.py`, fix the drifting side's plate/pose |
| Seam FAILs a few % but the frames look identical | a rig copy under the plate doubles its shadow | only the plate shows while it holds (frame.md seams) |
| Product UI drifts from the real app | rebuilt from memory or partial CSS | capture the real app at 2x (`surfaces.md` first section) |
| 800+ `duplicate_audio_track` warnings | SFX without `data-duration` | re-run `assemble.py` |
| `music-search` says no credential | not logged in | user runs `npx hyperframes auth login` in their terminal |
| `import librosa` fails | numba vs NumPy 2.5 | use music-analyze.py / music-bars.py; don't pip-fix |
| Render crawls ~1 frame/s | software GPU (Studio export) | `render-final.sh` (CLI, `--browser-gpu --workers 6`) |
| Render keeps running after stop | stopping the shell does not stop node | kill the process tree (verify-ship.md) |
| No render progress visible | output piped through `| tail` | log to a file (render-final.sh does) |

## Self-test

```bash
node <skill>/scripts/selftest.mjs
```

Scaffolds a 2-scene film in a temp folder, then runs the harness, assemble, `check`, seam-check, a hardware-GPU
render (1920x1080 at 60 fps) and the web encode. It must print `PASS` - run it on a new machine and after any edit.

## Sharing this skill

The folder is self-contained: copy `bo-spatial-film/` into another machine's `~/.claude/skills/`, install what
"What you need" lists, then run the self-test. It holds no machine paths, accounts or client data; the font
(Poppins, SIL OFL) ships with its licence in `template/assets/fonts/`. Before sending a changed copy, grep it for
local paths and names, run a secrets scan (`gitleaks dir .`) and skip `__pycache__/`.
