"""Flag gsap fromTo calls whose FROM vars set a property that no TO vars for that target ever animate.

GSAP only tweens the properties in the TO vars. A from-only property (e.g. `opacity: 1` in the from vars of a
lift tween) is applied when the timeline plays through it in order - which is what the harness does - but a
render worker that seeks straight into the middle of a scene never applies it, so the element stays at its
earlier value. HTTP Status Codes 2026-10-07: s09's lifted "4" was visible in every harness snapshot and invisible
in the render until its exit tween. Run before render:

    py -3.12 <skill>/scripts/fromto-scan.py compositions/s*.html

A from-only property is OK when another fromTo/to on the SAME target animates it (a split scale + fade pair).
Fix a real hit by adding the property to the TO vars (e.g. `opacity: 1`). Exit code 1 when anything is flagged.
