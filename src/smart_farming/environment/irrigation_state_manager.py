"""
Runtime manager for irrigation system state.

This module owns the mutable irrigation runtime state for every growing
zone within the HydroGrow Smart Farming Simulator.

Each growing zone is assigned one IrrigationState instance that
represents the current operating condition of the irrigation subsystem.

The IrrigationStateManager is the authoritative runtime source for
irrigation-related simulation data. Telemetry generators consume this
runtime state when constructing irrigation telemetry events.

Responsibilities
----------------
The manager is responsible for:

- Creating one IrrigationState per growing zone.
- Providing lookup access to runtime irrigation state.
- Providing enumeration of all irrigation states.

Future milestones will extend this manager with irrigation scheduling,
pump operation, nutrient dosing, equipment interaction, and runtime
simulation logic.
